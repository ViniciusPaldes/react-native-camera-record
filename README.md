# What is Camera Record
  
Camera Record is a code challenge to develop an Mobile App that records a video and don't recording even if the user flip the camera from back to front or otherwise.

## What technologies I used

To do this I used the following frameworks and libs:
 - React Native
 - Typescript
 - Ignite Bowser Boilerplate
 - Mobx State Tree
 - React Navigation v5
 - Hooks (useEffect, useMemo, useState)
 - react-native-camera
 - react-native-root-import / react-native-import-helper / husky

## To run the project

1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/ViniciusPaldes/react-native-camera-record`
2. Install the dependencies `yarn`
3. Run on real devices `react-native run-is` or `react-native-run-android`
4. To run on IOS, please open Xcode and select your developer account to sign the app

## Screens

The app have three screens:
- Main Screen - With a list of recorded lives
- Camera - With the available options to record live, flip the camera and cancel the operation
- Live Player - Screen to show the video recorded
